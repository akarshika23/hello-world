        <br>
         <p><i><b>Travelling</b>for me has been clutter-breaking.Spending my day differently, exploring in the truest sense of the word and in the process, getting fresh perspectives about people and places has been addictive.</i></p>
         ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        <p><i><b>Every day spent outdoors is satiating in different ways. Some days are about fighting down your own demons to try out something new. Sometimes it's about taking up a physical challenge that would almost kill you, often it's just about surviving a day in alien situations, and on some days the kindness of strangers moves you in a way that it ends up changing you.

            I'm sharing stories from four different days in my life that have been rewarding in so many ways. Every experience spans 24 hours, and looking back somehow it makes me think that there's no limit to what you can experience and learn in a single day.<br> Every day wasted doing something you do not enjoy somehow feels like a missed opportunity.</b></i></p>

        <h2><U>LIFE AS A FULL-TIME TRAVELLER-</U></h2>
        <P>Life as a full-time traveler is a bit of everything. It's complex, ever-changing, exciting, and even nerve-wracking at times. In this series you'll find a variety of posts that follow my personal journey of life as a full-time traveler since 2007, through 55+ countries.

            Come along with me! Discover why slow travel makes my heart sing, watch me pack and tell you about my best packing tips, learn from my travel blogging mistakes, and even dissect my year-over-year income and expense breakdowns.
            
            But remember, life isn't always pretty - on the road or off it. And sometimes, life's challenges are even harder while traveling. I mince no words and give you thereal scoop on topics like finding love on the road, having my passport stolen, surviving near-fatal accidents, natural disasters, and (much) more. </P>
