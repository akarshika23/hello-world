            <i><b>There are many quotes given by Sir Kalam that are life-changing.</b></i>I like to mention one of them :-<br>
             <p type=text-align:center><i>'It Is Very Easy To Defeat Someone, But It Is Very Hard To Win Someone'</i></p>A very simple person who lived an unpretentious lifestyle. He had a keen interest in literature and wrote poems.He never married. He always faced media himself for his failures while let others address for the success. He remained active till the very end. He died while delivering a lecture at the IIM.</p>
